# GameScorer

This app is a game scoring app for board games. This app makes it easier to keep track of the player's score for a few games.

Future plans: Make UI more asthetically pleasing, making sure it adheres to Google's material design specs. Add a few more games to the menu. Put database onto Firebase to make the app more device and memory friendly. 

Possible ideas: Make separate game scorers as DLC
